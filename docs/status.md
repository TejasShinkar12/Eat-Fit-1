## 3. Implementation Progress

### 3.1. Core MVP Features

- **User Authentication & Profile Setup:**
    - **Status:** Completed
    - **Notes:**
        - User registration, login, JWT authentication, and profile setup implemented (backend & frontend).
        - Pydantic schemas and validation in place.
        - Profile edit/view supported.
        - Security issues (password hash leakage, model mismatch) resolved.

- **Inventory Ingestion via Image:**
    - **Status:** In Progress

        - ML model integration (object detection, OCR) in progress.

- **Inventory View & Manual Edits:**
    - **Status:** In Progress
    - **Notes:**
        - **Inventory create (manual add) API is fully implemented and tested (backend).**
        - Inventory CRUD (edit, delete, mark as consumed) is not fully implemented (backend & frontend).
        - Pydantic summary/detail schemas and paginated endpoints in place.
        - Validation and error handling implemented.
        - Frontend screens for inventory list, add/edit, and detail not complete.

- **Fitness Profile-Based Calorie Tracking:**
    - **Status:** In Progress
    - **Notes:**
        - Consumption log models, endpoints, and schemas implemented.
        - Calorie/macronutrient tracking logic in backend.
        - Dashboard UI for daily/weekly stats in progress.
        - BMR/TDEE calculation logic present.

- **Recipe Generator:**
    - **Status:** In Progress
    - **Notes:**
        - Backend endpoint and schema stubs present.
        - ML model integration (text2text) in progress.
        - Frontend trigger and display UI pending.

- **Reports & Alerts:**
    - **Status:** In Progress
    - **Notes:**
        - Backend models and endpoints for reports scaffolded.
        - Logic for trend charts, top contributors, expiry/calorie alerts in progress.
        - Frontend UI for reports/alerts pending.

- **Basic Voice & Text Q&A (Optional for MVP):**
    - **Status:** Not Started
    - **Notes:**
        - No implementation yet; planned for post-MVP.

### 3.2. Data & Storage Infrastructure

- **PostgreSQL Database:**
    - **Status:** Implemented
    - **Notes:** Core tables (users, inventory, consumption_log) created and migrated. Alembic migrations up to date.
- **Logging Infrastructure:**
    - **Status:** Implemented
    - **Notes:** JSON structured logging, PII masking, and test coverage implemented.

---

## 4. Testing Status

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Logging system, PII masking, database models, inventory & consumption log schemas.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Authentication and inventory retrieval endpoints.
- **Manual Testing:**
    - In progress for implemented features.
- **Known Issues/Bugs:**
    - None critical; all previously reported issues resolved.

---

## 5. Risks and Issues

- **Feature Gaps:** Most MVP features (CRUD, ML, UI, reports) are not started.
- **Frontend-Backend Sync:** No inventory or calorie tracking UI; only authentication/profile flows are connected.

---

## 6. Next Steps

1. **Implement inventory and consumption log CRUD endpoints (backend) beyond create.**
2. Begin frontend development for inventory and calorie tracking UI.
3. Plan and scaffold ML features (image ingestion, recipe generation).
4. Expand test coverage as new features are added.

---

## 7. Notes

- Only authentication/profile and inventory/consumption log retrieval (backend) are currently functional.
- **Inventory create (manual add) API is now fully implemented and tested (backend).**
- No ML, CRUD (beyond create), reporting, or advanced features are implemented or scaffolded as of this report.
