# Project Status Report: FitEats MVP

## 1. Document Header

*   **Version:** 1.2
*   **Date:** [Update to Today]
*   **Prepared By:** [Your Name/Team Name]
*   **Reporting Period:** [e.g., June 2025]

## 2. Project Summary

*   **Project Goal:** Deliver an MVP for FitEats, an AI-powered inventory and nutrition tracker. The MVP aims to provide user authentication, profile setup, and inventory/consumption log retrieval as foundational features.
*   **Key Technologies:** FastAPI, PostgreSQL, React/React Native, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, Alembic.
*   **Overall Status:** Core backend CRUD for inventory is now complete and fully tested. Authentication/profile flows complete; inventory/consumption log retrieval and update available on backend; all other features not started.

## 3. Implementation Progress

### 3.1. Core MVP Features

- **User Authentication & Profile Setup:**
    - **Status:** Completed
    - **Notes:**
        - User registration, login, JWT authentication, and profile setup implemented (backend & frontend).
        - Pydantic schemas and validation in place.
        - Profile edit/view supported.
        - Security issues (password hash leakage, model mismatch) resolved.

- **Inventory Ingestion via Image:**
    - **Status:** In Progress
    - **Notes:**
        - Backend models and endpoints scaffolded.
        - Image upload and processing pipeline integration started.
        - UI for image upload pending.
        - ML model integration (object detection, OCR) in progress.

- **Inventory View & Manual Edits:**
    - **Status:** In Progress
    - **Notes:**
        - **Inventory create (manual add), update (PATCH), and delete (DELETE) APIs are now fully implemented and tested (backend).**
        - **Inventory CRUD (create, update, delete) is now complete and covered by comprehensive tests, including edge cases, ownership enforcement, validation, and cascade delete of consumption logs.**
        - Partial and full updates, ownership enforcement, validation, and error handling are all in place for inventory updates and deletes.
        - Comprehensive tests for the update and delete endpoints have been added.
        - Frontend screens for inventory list, add/edit, and detail not complete.

- **Fitness Profile-Based Calorie Tracking:**
    - **Status:** In Progress
    - **Notes:**
        - Consumption log models, endpoints, and schemas implemented.
        - Calorie/macronutrient tracking logic in backend.
        - Dashboard UI for daily/weekly stats in progress.
        - BMR/TDEE calculation logic present.

- **Recipe Generator:**
    - **Status:** In Progress
    - **Notes:**
        - Backend endpoint and schema stubs present.
        - ML model integration (text2text) in progress.
        - Frontend trigger and display UI pending.

- **Reports & Alerts:**
    - **Status:** In Progress
    - **Notes:**
        - Backend models and endpoints for reports scaffolded.
        - Logic for trend charts, top contributors, expiry/calorie alerts in progress.
        - Frontend UI for reports/alerts pending.

- **Basic Voice & Text Q&A (Optional for MVP):**
    - **Status:** Not Started
    - **Notes:**
        - No implementation yet; planned for post-MVP.

### 3.2. Data & Storage Infrastructure

- **PostgreSQL Database:**
    - **Status:** Implemented
    - **Notes:** Core tables (users, inventory, consumption_log) created and migrated. Alembic migrations up to date.
- **Logging Infrastructure:**
    - **Status:** Implemented
    - **Notes:** JSON structured logging, PII masking, and test coverage implemented.

---

## 4. Testing Status

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Logging system, PII masking, database models, inventory & consumption log schemas.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Authentication and inventory retrieval endpoints.
    - **Inventory update (PATCH) and delete (DELETE) endpoints are now fully covered with comprehensive tests, including edge cases, validation, ownership, and cascade delete.**
- **Manual Testing:**
    - In progress for implemented features.
- **Test Environment Fix:**
    - The test environment now uses `load_dotenv()` at the top of `conftest.py` to ensure all environment variables (including `DATABASE_URL_TEST`) are loaded before any database connections are made. This prevents accidental use or clearing of the main database during test runs.
    - This change fixed the previous issue where running tests could clear main database data if environment variables were not loaded in time.
- **Known Issues/Bugs:**
    - None; all previously reported issues resolved.

---

## 5. Risks and Issues

- **Feature Gaps:** Most MVP features (ML, UI, reports, consumption log CRUD) are not started.
- **Frontend-Backend Sync:** No inventory or calorie tracking UI; only authentication/profile flows are connected.

---

## 6. Next Steps

1. **Implement remaining CRUD endpoints for consumption logs (backend).**
2. Begin frontend development for inventory and calorie tracking UI.
3. Plan and scaffold ML features (image ingestion, recipe generation).
4. Expand test coverage as new features are added.

---

## 7. Notes

- Only authentication/profile and inventory/consumption log retrieval, update, and delete (backend) are currently functional.
- **Inventory create (manual add), update (PATCH), and delete (DELETE) APIs are now fully implemented and tested (backend).**
- No ML, CRUD for consumption logs, reporting, or advanced features are implemented or scaffolded as of this report.
