## 4. Testing Status

*(Summarize testing activities and results)*

*   **Overall QA Status:** Active - Initial test suites implemented
*   **Unit Tests:**
    * Logging system: ~95% coverage
    * PII masking: Comprehensive test suite
    * Database models: Basic tests
*   **Integration Tests:** Planned for authentication endpoints
*   **Manual Testing:** Not started
*   **Known Issues/Bugs:** 
    *   **RESOLVED:** `Critical: Password Hash Leakage`. The user API endpoints were exposing the `hashed_password`, creating a severe security vulnerability. This has been fixed by updating the `user_schema.User` Pydantic model to not include this field in API responses.
    *   **RESOLVED:** `Critical: Database Model and Migration Mismatch`. The SQLAlchemy `User` model was out of sync with the database schema from the Alembic migration, which would have caused runtime `OperationalError` exceptions. This has been fixed by updating the model and schemas.
*   **Testing Environment:** Local development setup

## 5. Risks and Issues

*(List current challenges, their potential impact, and mitigation plans)*

*   **Risk/Issue 1: [e.g., Accuracy of AI Models (Detection/OCR/Text2Text)]**
    *   **Impact:** [e.g., Poor inventory data, incorrect calorie tracking, irrelevant recipes]
    *   **Likelihood:** [e.g., High, Medium, Low]
    *   **Mitigation:** [e.g., Fine-tuning models with project-specific data, implementing manual correction workflows, setting confidence thresholds for AI output]
*   **Risk/Issue 2: [e.g., Performance of Image Processing Pipeline]**
    *   **Impact:** [e.g., Slow user experience for inventory ingestion]
    *   **Likelihood:** [e.g., Medium]
    *   **Mitigation:** [e.g., Optimize model inference, explore cloud processing options, add loading indicators]
*   **Risk/Issue 3: [e.g., Integration Complexity (Frontend <-> Backend <-> AI Models <-> DB)]**
    *   **Impact:** [e.g., Delays in feature delivery, bugs]
    *   **Likelihood:** [e.g., Medium]
    *   **Mitigation:** [e.g., Clear API contracts, phased integration testing, dedicated integration lead]
*   **Risk/Issue 4 (RESOLVED): Database Model and Migration Mismatch**
    *   **Impact:** Runtime `OperationalError` exceptions from SQLAlchemy, preventing user data operations.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (was occurring)
    *   **Mitigation:** The `User` model (`app/models/user.py`) and corresponding Pydantic schemas (`app/schemas/user.py`) have been updated to be fully synchronized with the Alembic migration schema. The incorrect fields were removed and the correct fields (height, weight, UUID for id, etc.) were added.
*   **Risk/Issue 5 (RESOLVED): Password Hash Leakage**
    *   **Impact:** User password hashes were exposed via the API, allowing for potential offline brute-force attacks to discover user passwords.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (was occurring)
    *   **Mitigation:** The `user_schema.User` Pydantic model (`app/schemas/user.py`) has been corrected to inherit from `UserBase` instead of `UserInDBBase`, which prevents the `hashed_password` field from being included in the API response model.
*   **Risk/Issue N: [Add more risks/issues as needed]**
    *   **Impact:**
    *   **Likelihood:**
    *   **Mitigation:**
